# Use Cases

## Easier Development
- Run multiple experiments at once.
- Iterate quickly on my solver based on data

## Automated testing
These tasks could take a few minutes, but they're run very frequently 
and often in parallel as people work in different branches or makes consecutive changes.

## Long running processes
These could take hours or days. At the end of the training you want to persist the output data and use it.
- Example: Training a Caffe network

## Publish
- Visualize the data and be able to download it to include on my reports.
- Display your results.
- Publish your environment.
- Allow people to run certain problems on your environment while keeping it private.

## Replicate experiments
- Replicate experiments in minutes. Same problem, same data, same solution, ideally same results.
- Use my dataset on somebody else's solution model
- Build my solution model on top of some other framework and some other data
- 3rd party validation of experiments

## Central Repository for the state-of-the-art algorithms 
- A single place where I can find all the experiments, results and the state of the art on anything
